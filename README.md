# Bonbon

A plugin for Obsidian, based on Boninall's workflow.

一个基于 Boninall 工作流的小插件。

Over time, I have had many small ideas for improving Obsidian. Sometimes these ideas are too small to warrant publishing as standalone plugins, but I still frequently need these minor improvements.

长久以来，我一直涌现了非常多的细小的 Obsidian 改进想法，这些想法有些时候太小以至于不应该将它们单独为一个插件发布，但是我又时常需要这些小改进。

So, I decided to integrate these small improvements into one plugin, and that's what Bonbon is.

于是，我决定将这些小改进集成到一个插件中，这就是 Bonbon。

In my imagination, Bonbon will have a lot of candy-level small features.

在设想中，Bonbon 会拥有非常多的糖果级的小功能。
